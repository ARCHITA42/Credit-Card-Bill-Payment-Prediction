# Credit-Card-Bill-Payment-Prediction
The Credit Card Bill Payment Prediction project utilizes logistic regression, a popular machine learning algorithm, to predict whether a client will pay their credit card bill or not. The project leverages a dataset consisting of three key features: income, age, and loan information. By training a logistic regression model on this dataset, the project aims to provide insights into the likelihood of a client paying their credit card bill based on their financial information.

The logistic regression algorithm is a powerful tool for binary classification problems, such as determining whether a client will make a payment or not. It calculates the probability of an event occurring, in this case, the probability of a client making a bill payment. By analyzing the relationships between income, age, loan, and the target variable (bill payment status), the logistic regression model can learn patterns and make predictions on unseen data.

The logistic regression model achieved an impressive accuracy of 92.83 percent in predicting credit card bill payments. This high accuracy indicates that the model was able to make correct predictions for approximately 92.83 percent of the instances in the dataset.
